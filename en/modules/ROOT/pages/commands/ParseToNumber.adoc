ParseToNumber( <Number>, <String> )::
  Parses the text and stores the result to a xref:/Numbers_and_Angles.adoc[number] _a_, which must be defined and
  xref:/Free_Dependent_and_Auxiliary_Objects.adoc[free] before the command is used.

[EXAMPLE]
====

Define `++ a = 3++` and `++ text1 = "6"++`. `++ ParseToNumber(a, text1)++` returns _a = 6_.

====

[NOTE]
====

This is a xref:/commands/Scripting_Commands.adoc[scripting command] which only sets the value of a number once. To
convert a text _text1_ into a number which is updated dynamically, use xref:/commands/FromBase.adoc[FromBase](text1,10).
