StepGraph( <List of Points> )::
  Draws a step graph of the given list of points. Each point is connected to the next point in the list by a horizontal
  line segment.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++StepGraph({(1, 1), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 7)})++`

====

StepGraph( <List of Points>, <Boolean Join> )::
  Draws a step graph of the given list of points. If _Join = false_, then a horizontal line segment is drawn towards the
  x-coordinate of the next point, but a vertical line segment is not drawn. If _Join = true_, then each point is
  connected to the next point in the list by a horizontal and a vertical line segment.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++StepGraph({(1, 1), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 7)}, true)++`

====

StepGraph( <List of x-coordinates>, <List of y-coordinates> )::
  Draws a step graph of a list of points created from the given lists of coordinates. Each point is connected to the
  next point in the list by a horizontal line segment.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++StepGraph({1, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 5, 7})++`

====

StepGraph( <List of x-coordinates>, <List of y-coordinates>, <Boolean Join> )::
  Draws a step graph of a list of points created from the given lists of coordinates. If _Join = false_, then a
  horizontal line segment is drawn towards the x-coordinate of the next point, but a vertical line segment is not drawn.
  If _Join = true_, then each point is connected to the next point in the list by a horizontal and a vertical line
  segment.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++StepGraph({1, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 5, 7}, true)++`

====

StepGraph( <List of x-coordinates>, <List of y-coordinates>, <Boolean Join>, <Point Style> )::
  Draws a step graph as described above.
  Point style values of _-2, -1, 0, 1, -1_ determine how points are drawn as follows:
  * _0_ = no points are drawn
  * _1_ = solid points on the right
  * _2_ = solid points on the right, open points on the left
  * _-1_ = solid points on the left
  * _-2_ = solid points on the left, open points on the right

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++StepGraph({1, 3, 4, 5}, {1, 2, 5, 7}, false, 1)++`

====

StepGraph( <List of Points>, <Boolean Join>, <Point Style> )::
  Draws a step graph as described above.

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++StepGraph({(1, 1), (3, 2), (4, 5), (5, 7)}, false, 1)++`
