Activate the tool, then:

* Select or create two points in the _xOy plane_ to obtain a regular tetrahedron with one edge defined by the two given points, and lying on the _xOy_ plane.

or

* Select two points having the same _z_-coordinate, _z=c_, to obtain a regular tetrahedron lying on the plane _z = c_, with one edge of the base defined by the two given points. The tetrahedron can be rotated around the specified edge by dragging the third vertex of the base, created automatically.

or

* Select two points having different z-coordinates to obtain a regular tetrahedron with the edge of one face defined by the two given points and the third vertex of the same face having as _z_-coordinate the average of the _z_-coordinates of the given points. The tetrahedron can be rotated around the specified edge by dragging the third vertex of the base, created automatically.
