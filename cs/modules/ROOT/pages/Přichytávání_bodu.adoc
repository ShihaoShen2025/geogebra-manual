The _Point Capturing_ feature is part of the xref:/Style_Bar.adoc[_Graphics View_ and _3D Graphics View Style Bar_] and
offers four different options for points:

* *Automatic*: turns _Point Capturing_ _On_ when the grid or the coordinate axes are shown, and _Off_ when both are
hidden.
* *Snap to Grid*: when a point is close enough to an intersection of lines of the grid, it will align to it.
* *Fixed to Grid*: a point can be placed only on the intersections of lines of the grid.
* *Off*: no capturing is applied to the point.

[NOTE]
====

_Snap to Grid_ and _Fixed to Grid_ options, when selected, remain active even though the grid is hidden.
