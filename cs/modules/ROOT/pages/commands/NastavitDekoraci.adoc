SetDecoration( <Object>, <Number> )::
  Sets the decoration of the given object (see also the _Style_ tab in the _Properties_ window of the object). The
  object must be an angle, a segment or a "fillable object". The second argument in the command is the numeric code of
  the decoration / fill-style, as described in the following table.

SetDecoration(<Segment>, <Number>, <Number>)::

  two points that define the vertices of the segment. The segment decoration can also be set in the _Style_ tab of the
  _Properties_ window of the segment. The first number used as command parameter defines the style of the line segment
  start, and the second number sets the style of the line segment end, as described in the following table.
